At the request of many families and physical therapists, we added features to this code to allow remote control of the go baby go car.

* on/off switch
* on/off buttons
* joystick/button toggling
* RC receiver input

Please talk to a physical therapist about the best way to use a remote control to benefit the kid, and take a look at these resources: (remote control user manual coming soon)
